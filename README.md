Weâ€™ve all been there: Stuck at a traffic light, only to be given mere seconds to pass through an intersection, behind a parade of other commuters. Imagine if you could help city planners and governments anticipate traffic hot spots ahead of time and reduce the stop-and-go stress of millions of commuters like you.

Geotab provides a wide variety of aggregate datasets gathered from commercial vehicle telematics devices. Harnessing the insights from this data has the power to improve safety, optimize operations, and identify opportunities for infrastructure challenges.

The dataset includes aggregate stopped vehicle information and intersection wait times. Let's try to understand the factors affecting congestion at intersections and predict congestion, based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times, at intersections in 4 major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia.
